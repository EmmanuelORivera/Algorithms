# Algorithms

This is going to be a git repository to practice algorithms from
the book Grokking Algorithms.

All the content is going to be separated by different branches
for example 1-BinarySearch

## Some common Big O run times 
### This are sorted from fastest to slowest
- O(log n), also known as log time. Example: Binary search.
- O(n), also known as linear time. Example: Simple search.
- O(n * log n). Example: A fast sorting algorithm, like quicksort
- O(n 2 ). Example: A slow sorting algorithm, like selection sort
- O(n!). Example: A really slow algorithm, like the traveling
salesperson.
